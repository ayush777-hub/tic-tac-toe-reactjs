# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a tic tac toe game that displays the board and two users playing in it.
Player A is assigned 'X' and player B is assigned 'O'. This is a fun project just to learn basics of 
ReactJS. 



## Lessons Learned

I learnt about Use state and have used them to handle different elements in the page
like the dak and light mode, the scores of each player, flashing the results 
of the game.
